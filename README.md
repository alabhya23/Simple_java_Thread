# Simple_java_Thread
## Java Threads Demo

## Description
This repository demonstrates how to use threads in Java by defining different thread classes for different tasks.

## Files and Functions

1. `MainThreadDemo.java` - Starts all threads.
2. `PrintNumbers.java` - Prints numbers 1 to 5 in a separate thread.
3. `PrintCharacters.java` - Prints characters A to E in a separate thread.
4. `PrintMessage.java` - Prints a custom message multiple times in a separate thread.

Each thread is run independently to show multi-threading in action.
